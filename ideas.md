# Ideas

Not sure if all of these are possible.

* Remove fast inserters
* Make train only accept wood as fuel
* Remove train signals


* Demolisher remains are unmineable
* Crashed spaceship is unmineable
* Landfill chunks absorb pollution
* Power poles cannot be placed adjacent to each other
* Turrets (gun-, laser-, flame-, and artillery) will explode after 30 minutes to discourage making base defense
* Randomly start researching another level of "You got sidetracked" which cannot be skipped
* Kovarex is a trigger tech which requires you to produce 1TJ of nuclear power first
* Random notification saying "read chat"
* Add spellchecking on save-game names
* Warning when repair packs are in inventory and biters have been aggro:d or are close by
* Warning when not cancelling the blinking when research finishes
* Achievements:
    * handfeeding at least 1000 items of a single type
    * player not moving while rocket is being launched
    * putting 100k fish in a lake

# World generation hacks

* Starter area contains a small lake with a single fish in it
* Always place a single worm in the starting area with a map marker designating it Johnny
* Place the holy tree of wisdom in the starting area, and light it up somehow
