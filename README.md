A Factorio mod which gives the player the authentic Michael Hendrick's
experience.

* Fast inserters technology is locked behind cryogenic science
* Locomotives only accept wood as fuel
* Rail and chain signals have been removed
* Demolisher remains are unmineable
* Crashed spaceship is unmineable
* Landfill chunks absorb pollution
* 1 small worm "Little Johnny" is placed at a random location near spawn. This
  worm is indestructible.
* 1 tree "The Holy Tree of Wisdom" is placed at a random location near spawn. This
  tree is indestructible, and it will automatically heal itself from any damage taken
  from pollution.
